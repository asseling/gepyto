Annotation module (``annotation``)
===================================

CADD
-----

`CADD <http://cadd.gs.washington.edu>`_ is a tool to predict variant
deleteriousness based on multiple features. It can score variants from any
genomic region.

RegulomeDB
----------

`RegulomeDB <http://regulomedb.org>`_ is a database that annotates SNPs with
known and predicted regulatory elements in the intergenic regions of the *Homo.
sapiens* genome. Known and predicted regulatory DNA elements include regions of
DNAase hypersensitivity, binding sites of transcription factors, and promoter
regions that have been biochemically characterized to regulation transcription.
Source of these data include public datasets from GEO, the ENCODE project, and
published literature. The tool can also score variants from any genomic region.
