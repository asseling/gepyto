# Introduction

This is a small module that contains reusable code. I aim to use it as a 
submodule for other projects.

# Features

- Python objects for Indels and SNPs.
- Abstraction of the Ensembl API for variant queries in a range and from an rs
  number.
- Throttling for Ensembl database queries.

# WIP

- Checking of reference alleles for Variants using a provided genome reference.
- Annotation module.
